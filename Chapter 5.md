Chapter 5: Summary and What’s Next?

Summary of what you’ve learned

Let’s summarize the main concepts of this starter kit:

● Product recommendations is one of the most commonly used applications of behavior

● If you don’t have a real transaction log before you get started on the development of 

● Qubell makes is easy to package all components of a distributed system, including

● You may want specifically to change the deployment infrastructure from Amazon cloud 

to any other public cloud, a private cloud or an internal non-cloud environment. 

● Note: for use of Qubell on non-public clouds you’ll need to upgrade your free account to 

a paid enterprise account. Contact info@qubell.com for more information

● Develop other analytics applications using our Hadoop development, deployment and 

management infrastructure. 

● Contact Grid Dynamics at starterkit@griddynamics.com with any other ideas and we’ll
