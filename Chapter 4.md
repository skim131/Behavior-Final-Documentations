Chapter 4: Working with Recommendation Engine
=============================================
To Launch Recommendation Engine
-------------------------------
Let’s begin at looking at the recommendation engine by starting one up. Go to Applications ->Recommendation Engine -> Launch -> Advance Launch

PRINT SCREEN

Leave all fields at their default values, except three:
- Set name to myEngine
- Set environment to Test
- Set auto-destruction to 4 hours
- Set revision to blank
- Set slave quantify to 4, as a default

Press “Launch”. 

It should take about 20 minutes for the application to come up. Once the Hadoop cluster comes up successfully you can see it through the management tools and start working with it. Meanwhile, we’ll continue looking at the parts of the Recommendation Engine available to us. 

How This Recommendation Engine Works
------------------------------------
At a 10,000 foot view, this recommendation works in the following way. 

First, someone loads up on S3 a transaction log file. The transaction log file represents the historic purchases made by prior customers of the web store. The recommendation engine will find patterns in transaction log based the purchase history according to a certain distributed algorithm executed in the cluster. The result is a file stored in HDFS that contains recommendations. Once the recommendations are computed and stored in a file, they are copied from the local HDFS to S3, where our web store can pick them up. 

Now, unfortunately, getting access to real user transactions for a sample web store is quite impossible since the store is fake and no one is really shopping there. Fortunately, we have a generator of transaction logs based on product catalog structure and some configuration parameters. This generator was written by the analytics team in Grid Dynamics who wrote similar generators to some of their real eCommerce customers to be able to train and test their algorithms. The algorithm to produce the transaction log is also written as a Hadoop job. 

Default files can be found here:
- Transaction log
- Catalog structure
- Configuration file for transaction log
- Transaction log generator, in java
- Resulting transaction log
- Recommendation algorithm, in java
- Resulting recommendation file

Recommendation Engine Workflows
-------------------------------
To understand how this engine works, let’s look at the action workflows defined on it. You can always find the details of each action in the manifest. We are going to start with a very short overview of the actions, their purpose and implementation. The main sections of that manifest include:

**Launch:** as you might expect, this action starts up a cluster with one master and requested number of slave nodes. it will also configure the cluster to be monitored by an external tool, Ganglia, and start-up that tool

**Scale_up_cluster:** this action will add a requested number of slave nodes to already existing cluster

**Generate_new_transaction_log:** this action takes a product catalog structure file from HDFS, and a configuration file for the algorithm, runs a job to generate recommendations and stores the result in a transaction log file on stored again on HDFS.

**Save_transaction_log_to_S3:** this action moves the transaction log from HDFS to S3 for persistent storage. Note: in the real world, this file can be very large and moving it around might be quite slow and expensive. A different architecture would be needed if this was a truly large-scale log

**Load_transaction_log_from_S3:** this action moves the transaction log from S3 to HDFS prior to computation of recommendations, if necessary

**Compute_new_recommendations:** this action takes a transaction log from HDFS,and a configuration parameters for the algorithm, runs a job to generates recommendations and saves the results in the recommendation file on local HDFS and on S3.

This is the main job of the recommendation engine. More on how it works later
- Save_tansaction_log_to_S3: this action will move the transaction log from Hadoop’s local HDFS to S3 to persist for future use. This is where Web Store will take it from
- Load_transaction_log_from_S3:

Hadoop Management Tools
-----------------------
We’ve integrated three popular tools that can be used to gain insight into the state of the Hadoop cluster. You can find them on the portal associated with a living instance of a cluster
